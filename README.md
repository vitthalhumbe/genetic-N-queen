# Genetic Algorithm to solve N-Queen problem

This project implements the Genetic Algorithm (Evolutionary Algorithm) to solve the popular N-Queen problem. 


## in short summary -
|term| meaning|
|----|--------|
|Generation| Number of trials|
|Population| Number of candidate solution per generaiton|
|candidate / Solution (DNA) | string/list of alphabet ACGT |
|fitness function| Evaluates the value of solution|
|selection funciton| selects parents for reproduction of solution|
|crossover| method to generate the offsprings (next solutions)|
|mutation| randomly changing number of bits in solution.|
